Map game

Preview Album: https://imgur.com/a/bPB9LKq

Abandoned. Map works well though and is pretty nifty, uses PNGs in Assets/StreamingAssets/Worlds/Mand_0 combined with WorldManager's
World Data to generate a world map as seen in the album. Resources System is flexible but needs more work. Lots of code is old and
therefore messy, overuses if statements, etc.

Game in Builds folder - Miasta.exe
Code in Assets/Scripts/

It's possible to build on the map using the buttons on top but you need sufficient resources.
To cheat in all resources, press Ctrl + A or ` + A if in the Unity Editor.
Ctrl + S (or ` + S in unity editor) to save.
